## Recommendation

Use atleast 100 images for the classification during initialization to make the model work better.`more data = greater accuracy`

## Test

When I tried it , the program worked really good provided just 40 images:

    classified `i Phone X` and `Oneplus 6`
    accuracy was 39 out of 40 times
